# Bare Bones Spelling Corrector

This project is a from-scratch spelling corrector in Python. The word list used as the dictionary is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english.txt), ordered by decreasing frequency.

Also included is a write-up detailing an example application. The spelling corrector was applied to a systematically corrupted version of Jane Austen's *Sense and Sensibility* and then compared to the original text. Also included is the code used to corrupt the book and the file implementing the test case.
